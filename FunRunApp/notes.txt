Plan for the future

	-Persistent data structure with completed legs.
		Class RunData
			List<GoogleLeg> legs
			List<Long> legTimesMillis
			assert(legTimesMillis.size()==legs.size()

			int totalDistanceMeters
			double avg_speed (miles per hour / meters per second?)  

		Class AllRuns implements java.io.Serializable
			List<RunData>

Finished loading dialogs. 
Tracks your actual path ran. 

TODO: 

	-Make proximity listeners for every step. Get rid of all previous listeners when a step is finished. 
	-In StepComplete activity store appropriate data. 
	-Must complete a step to track your movement? Seems like a natural solution. 
		*Must delete the leg if a step isn't completed. 

	-Persist to disk
