<h2>Description of the app</h2>

<p><dd>
	This app helps runners plot a route through a city, passing by various places of interest.

<b>Please do not rate this app poorly due to inherent inaccuracy in your phone&apos;s GPS unit. Your location in this app will be identical 
to your location in Google Maps!</b>
